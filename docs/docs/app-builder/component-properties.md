ToolJet offers a variety of highly customizable components. Each component can be customized by setting its properties. The Properties Panel, which appears on the right side when a component is selected, includes two tabs:

- **Properties**: Used to configure the functional aspects of the component.
- **Styles**: Used to customize the appearance, such as colors, border radius, and other styling options.

Each component has its own set of properties based on its functionality. This guide covers some of the commonly used properties across components.

## Properties

### Events

Events can be configured for each component to trigger actions such as running a query, showing an alert, and more, based on specific user interactions like clicks or hover events.
For more details, refer to the [Events and Logic](#) guide.
