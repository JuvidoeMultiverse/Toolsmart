**Components** in ToolJet are the basic building blocks used to create applications. These are pre-designed elements that can be placed onto the [canvas](#). The **Components Library**, located on the right side, contains all [available components](/docs/widgets/overview). Components can be added to the canvas by dragging them from the library. The components are organized into different categories and can be found either by scrolling or by using the search bar.

## Properties Panel

The **Properties Panel** displays all available settings for the selected component. It allows setting values, updating component names, and creating event handlers, etc. The available properties vary depending on the component type. The panel has two tabs: **Properties** and **Styles**. To open the Property Panel, select a component on the canvas and the panel will appear on the right side.

## Custom Components

ToolJet allows for the creation of **Custom Components** using React. This feature is invaluable for developers who require functionality beyond the pre-built components offered by ToolJet. To create a **Custom Component**, drag and drop the **Custom Component** onto the canvas, then configure its data and code accordingly. For more information, refer to the [Custom Component Guide](#).
