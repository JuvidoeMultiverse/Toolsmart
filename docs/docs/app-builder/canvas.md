**Canvas** is the center area in the ToolJet app builder used for designing the UI of an application. It also serves as the space for displaying data and results. After the application is published, this is the area that the End Users will see and interact with.

### Arrange Components

Components can be arranged on the canvas by dragging them from the component library on the right. To move a component without affecting others, click and hold the **Component Handle** to change component's position. Or you can set the position of selected components using keyboard arrow keys after clicking the component handle.

### Resize Components

The size of any component on the canvas can be adjusted by resizing it from its edges as required.

### Group Components

In ToolJet, components related to the same feature can be grouped using a **[Container](#)** or a **[Form](#)**. Required components can be dragged and dropped inside the container or form on the canvas. This creates a group of nested components.

### Hide Components

A component can be hidden by setting its **Visibility** property to `false`. The visibility can be changed using the toggle button or dynamically by clicking **fx** and providing a logical expression.

### Disable Components

A component can be disabled by setting its **Disable** property to true. This property can be updated using the toggle button or dynamically by clicking **fx** and providing a logical expression.

### Clone Components

You can clone existing components on the canvas by **cmd/ctrl + d**. Check other **[Keyboard Shortcuts](/docs/tutorial/keyboard-shortcuts)**.
