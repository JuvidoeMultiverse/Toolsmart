title: Defining Application Behaviour on Event Triggers
---

Events are used to define how your app should respond when a user interacts with a component or when a specific system condition is met. Whether it's clicking a button, selecting an item from a dropdown, or completing a data query, events let you tie in logic that makes your app interactive and reactive.

You can use event triggers to run queries, update variables, show alerts, navigate to different pages, and more. Each event can be configured to trigger one or more actions in sequence, allowing you to build complex logic flows easily. Refer to the individual [component guide](#) to see the full list of supported events, and check out the [Action Reference](#) for all available actions.
