title: Events and Actions Overview
---

Events are used to make the ToolJet application responsive. Events are actions or triggers that occur when a user interacts with a component or when a specific system condition is met. They let you define custom logic (like running a query, navigating to a page, or showing a toast) in response to user activity or app changes â€” without writing backend code.

Different components have different sets of events based on their functionality, for example a button has `onClick` event, while a dropdown has `onSelect` event, you can checkout all the available events for a component using the Inspector or checkout the individual component docs.
